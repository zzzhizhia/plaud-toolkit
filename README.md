# plaud

> **Alpha** — Early test version. Building in public, testing on my own recordings.

Unofficial TypeScript toolkit for the [Plaud](https://www.plaud.ai/) API — core library, CLI, and MCP server.

## Why

[Plaud](https://www.plaud.ai/) makes AI-powered wearable recorders (Plaud Note, Plaud NotePin) that capture meetings, conversations, and voice notes, then transcribe and summarize them in the cloud. Great hardware, but all your data lives behind their app with no official API or export tools.

This toolkit gives you programmatic access to your own recordings. Download audio files, pull transcripts, sync everything to local folders — your data, your workflow. Built as a monorepo with three packages:

- **`@plaud/core`** — Shared library: authentication, API client, config management. Handles token lifecycle automatically (tokens last ~300 days, auto-refresh when within 30 days of expiry).
- **`@plaud/cli`** — Command-line tool to list, download, transcribe, and sync recordings.
- **`@plaud/mcp`** — [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) that exposes your Plaud recordings to AI assistants like Claude, making your voice notes searchable and accessible from any MCP-compatible tool.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergivalverde/plaud.git
cd plaud && pnpm install
```

### 1. Login

```bash
pnpx tsx packages/cli/bin/plaud.ts login
```

Enter your email, password, and region (us/eu). Credentials are stored locally in `~/.plaud/config.json` (mode 0600).

> **Note:** If you use Google Sign-In on Plaud, first set a password via "Forgot Password" on [web.plaud.ai](https://web.plaud.ai).

### 2. CLI Usage

```bash
# List recordings
pnpx tsx packages/cli/bin/plaud.ts list

# Get transcript
pnpx tsx packages/cli/bin/plaud.ts transcript <recording-id>

# Download audio
pnpx tsx packages/cli/bin/plaud.ts download <recording-id> ./audio/

# Sync all recordings to a folder
pnpx tsx packages/cli/bin/plaud.ts sync ./plaud-notes/
```

### 3. MCP Server

Add to your Claude config (`~/.claude.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plaud": {
      "command": "pnpx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/plaud/packages/mcp/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tools available:
- `plaud_list_recordings` — list all recordings
- `plaud_get_transcript` — get transcript by recording ID
- `plaud_get_recording_detail` — full recording metadata
- `plaud_user_info` — account info
- `plaud_get_mp3_url` — temporary MP3 download URL

## Token Management

Tokens are obtained automatically via email+password and last ~300 days. The library refreshes silently when a token is within 30 days of expiry. No manual intervention needed after initial `plaud login`.

## API

The API was reverse-engineered from the Plaud web app. This is an unofficial project — not affiliated with or endorsed by Plaud.
